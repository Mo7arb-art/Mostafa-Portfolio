      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I specialize in React, JavaScript, and responsive design. My approach
        focuses on crafting intuitive, visually engaging interfaces that make
        users fall in love with the product experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every design decision—from layout to color palette—is made to spark
        trust, delight, and lasting connection. What sets me apart is my hunger
        to learn and my refusal to be stopped by technical roadblocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's troubleshooting layout bugs or mastering new frameworks,
        I'm not just building websites. I'm building a future where creativity
        meets resilience.
